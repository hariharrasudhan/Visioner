# Visioner

An Android App for **visually challenged people**. The app guides people to walk with voice feedback or vibration feedback. 

## Motivation 

According to **World Health Organization**, Globally the number of people of all ages visually impaired is estimated to be 285 million, of whom 39 million are blind. People 50 years and older are 82% of all blind. 
So I came up with an app idea that will help blind people to walk safely indoor as well as outdoor. 
The app can very well recognize household items and humans. Idea is **to detect** such objects **with your smartphone camera** and tell you on which part of the screen(quadrant, 3X3, 2X4) **the particular object is**. The person will then take appropriate action. 

## Problem Statement

Without Vision it can be **challenging** for a visually impaired person to **navigate** through a room or a hallway **without bumping** into obstacles. 

**Even with aid,** such as walking stick, it can be sometimes **inconvenient ,uncomfortable**, and perhaps inaccurate in avoiding obstacles. As we can see, blind people is having their trouble to do their life routine because they cant even see a single things which **consumes their regular time.**

## Solution

This project is designed especially for **any** kind of **visually impaired persons**; blind, partially sighted and people with progressive loss of vision. Our **main objective** is to develop a **user friendly product** but will still maintain with a good functional system for the visually impaired individuals .This software can **scan any objects** and tells what product is this. Hence, the visually impaired person able to **more likes a normal person** in their daily lifestyle.

## Technology

The app uses Tensorflow lite as backend. The machine learning model used is 
is MobileNet SSD trained on the famous COCO dataset. You do not have to do anything to download these pretrained models , the gradle script handles it for you.
